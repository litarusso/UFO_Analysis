# UFO_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand where and when Ufo's are seen more. In this project I helped Dana. Dana is a data journalist end she writes an article about UFO sightseings at her hometown McMinnville, Oregon.
Wiht Dana we wanted to make a dinamic webpage to make the data available for people who are interested.
For that project I used my knowlege of Java Script, Html, CSS, and Bootstarp. In addition, I alse used ChromeDev tools to test the code.

First I prepared a table with HTML (index.html) to be ready to run the js code and filter the data in the fields. The data was ready in the data.js file.

Results:
I've prepared a user friendly tool to search the data.The variables of filtering are date, city, state, country, shape, duration and command. For now it can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country and Shape.

1- You can find the filtered tables below. You will see at that those tables has every other fields to understand the data selected. 
2- In order to search with more than one variable you can filter as meny field you want. As you see at the picture.......

- The fields (analiz edilebilecek) are:
  Date, City, State, Country and Shape.
- 
Althought when we think about UFO's we think about circle shapes because of the movies, people who see circle shapes are not the majority.

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
Summary:

The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage (2 pt)
The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development (4 pt)
