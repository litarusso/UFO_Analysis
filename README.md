# UFO_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand where and when Ufo's are seen more. In this project I helped Dana. Dana is a data journalist end she writes an article about UFO sightseings at her hometown McMinnville, Oregon.
Wiht Dana we wanted to make a dinamic webpage to make the data available for people who are interested.
For that project I used my knowlege of Java Script, Html, CSS, and Bootstarp. In addition, I alse used ChromeDev tools to test the code.

First I prepared a table with HTML (index.html) to be ready to run the js code and filter the data in the fields. The data was ready in the data.js file.

Results:

- 1-I've prepared a user friendly tool to search the data.The criteria of filtering are "date, city, state, country, shape, duration and command". For now it can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country and Shape.

- 2- You can find the filtered tables below. You will see that those tables has every other fields to understand the the data selected. You can select as many boxes as you want and write the new criteria in it.

- 3- In order to search with more than one criteria, you can select as many boxes as you want.

Summary:
In summary, this analysis is a perfect oportunity for people who are interested in UFO sighting.
However this page is not an appealing page because it is not interactive. We can't reach enough people with that. 

My suggestions about improving this project are below:
- 1- At that html page there is no pictures or videos. We can add some pictures ad videos into the page. In addition we can add some links of the webpages who are about UFO sighting.
- 2- I can ad a new button which will open an interactive box to let people write their own experience with Ufo's. We will ad that data as well to the data page.
- 3- In order to clean the multiple data and wrong spellings. So I have to write an aditional cleaning code and run that code time to time.
