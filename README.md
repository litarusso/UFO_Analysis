# UFO_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

This analysis aims to understand where and when Ufo's are seen more. In this project, I helped Dana. Dana, a data journalist, writes an article about UFO sightings in her hometown McMinnville, Oregon.
We wanted to prepare a dynamic webpage with Dana to make the data available to interested people.
I used my knowledge of JavaScript, Html, CSS, and Bootstrap for that project. In addition, I also used ChromeDev tools to test the code.

First, I prepared a table with HTML (index.html) to run the js code and filter the data in the fields. The data was already in the data.js file.

Results:

- 1-I've prepared a user-friendly tool to search the data. The filtering criteria are "date, city, state, country, shape, duration and command. It can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country and Shape.

- 2- You can find the filtered tables below. You will see that those tables have every other field to understand the data selected. You can choose as many boxes as possible and write the new criteria.

- 3- To search with more than one criterion, you can select as many boxes as you want.

Summary:
This analysis is a perfect opportunity for people interested in UFO sightings.
However, this page could be more appealing with interactivity. As it is not interactive and without pictures, it is not a presentable page.

My suggestions for improving this project are below:
- 1- There are no pictures or videos on that HTML page. We can add some pictures ad videos to the page. In addition, we can add some links to the web pages that are about UFO sightings.
- 2- I can add a new button that will open an interactive box to let people write their experiences with UFOs. We will add that data as well to the data page.
- 3- To clean the multiple data and wrong spellings. So I have to write an additional cleaning code and run that code from time to time.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity of doing this project.
