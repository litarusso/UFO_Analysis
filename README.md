# UFO_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand where and when Ufo's are seen more. In this project I helped Dana. Dana is a data journalist end she writes an article about UFO sightseings at her hometown McMinnville, Oregon.
Wiht Dana we wanted to make a dinamic webpage to make the data available for people who are interested.
For that project I used my knowlege of Java Script, Html, CSS, and Bootstarp. In addition, I alse used ChromeDev tools to test the code.

First I prepared a table with HTML (index.html) to be ready to run the js code and filter the data in the fields. The data was ready in the data.js file.

Results:
- The table is ready to (yayinlamak). People who are interested in Ufo's can analyze it from that table.
- The fields (analiz edilebilecek) are:
  Date, City, State, Country and Shape.
-
Althought when we think about UFO's we think about circle shapes because of the movies, people who see circle shapes are not the majority.
